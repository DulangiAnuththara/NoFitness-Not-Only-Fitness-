## Fitness tracker
  In this case I created pedometer activity to count steps and anlyse statics referring <a href=https://github.com/j4velin/Pedometer>j4velin pedometer</a> by Thomas Hoffmann. To make that I use hardaware step count sensor and step detector.when we concern power consumption and accurecy it's better to use than accelorometer. And also I use <a href=https://github.com/blackfizz/EazeGraph>EazeGraphLibrary</a> by Paul Cech and <a href="https://github.com/attenzione/android-ColorPickerPreference">Android color picking library</a> by Sergey Margaritov.
